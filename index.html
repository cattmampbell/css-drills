                    The Time Machine
                </span>
                is a science fiction novella by H.G. Wells, published in 1895 and written as a frame narrative. The work is generally credited
                with the popularization of the concept of time travel by using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel
                purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term "time machine", coined by Wells, is now
                almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle.
